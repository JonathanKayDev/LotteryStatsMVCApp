# Lottery Stats

Lottery Stats is an app which demonstrates retrieving online National Lottery draw data (csv format), storing the data in a PostgreSQL database, and calculating statistics from the data.

The app utilises role-based security system, which restricts access to certain pages and actions, so that only the site admin can request to update the draw data.

The app was built with ASP.NET MVC, C# and SQL. The front end was developed with HTML, JavaScript, CSS and Bootstrap, using a bootstrap template as a foundation. The backend utilises MVC and C#, with a PostgreSQL database hosted on Heroku. Heroku is a platform as service (PaaS) that enables developers to run and operate applications in the cloud.
